This project presents a secure, privacy-preserving framework for healthcare data analysis and prediction. 
It integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Lottery Federated Learning (Lottery FL) to enable decentralized model training while enhancing data privacy. 
Differential Privacy (DP) ensures sensitive data protection, while Quantum Key Exchange (QKE) secures communication and parameter sharing. 
Ensemble learning techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and hybrid models combining Neural Networks (ANN) with SVM, deliver high accuracy. 
The system is stress-tested against adversarial attacks such as Membership Inference and Gradient Leakage, ensuring resilience in AI-driven healthcare applications.
